# GNP-Time-Series-analysis-by-Ehsan-Ghani
The motivation of this analysis is to understand the future behaviour of the time series data 'Quarterly U.S. GNP' (Gross National Product) from 1947-2023. To this end, I will use Meta's Prophet forecasting system to generate a prediction of up to this year's (2025) values. To verify the robustness of the forecast, I will further analyse non-parametric forecasting and parametric methods to understand to what extent the dependence of GNP growth is linear over time.
